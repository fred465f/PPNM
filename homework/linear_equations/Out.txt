----- Check QR-decomp. -----

A = QR
R in QR-decomp. was indeed upper triangular.
Q in QR-decomp. was indeed orthogonal.


----- Check linear eq. solver -----

A possible solution to Ax = b was found. Result was indeed a solution to linear eq.


----- Check inverse solver -----

Possible inverse of matrix were found. Result was indeed the inverse.
