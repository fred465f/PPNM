# This file contains data regarding convergence of GSE of radial s-wave solution to SE of H-atom.
# Parameters are absolute error of ODE integrator (accODE), relative error of ODE 
# integrator (epsODE), and integration limits of ODE integrator rMin and rMax.
# Their default values are: accODE = 0.01, epsODE = 0.01, rMin = 0.1 and rMax = 8.
In this file the parameter  is varied with the others kept constant at their default values.
