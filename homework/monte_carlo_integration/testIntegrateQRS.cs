/* Program tests implementation of Quasi-Random sequence Monte-Carlo integrator in MonteCarloIntegrator class.
Estimated error is compared to actual error, and error scaling is compared to that of the Plain Monte-Carlo 
integrator. This is done by outputting data to standard output stream for later plotting. */
