---------------- Test # 1 ----------------

Performed SVD using implemented algorithm on 100 real square matrices A 
each of random size in [1, 50] and checked whether U and V are orthogonal and 
whether A = USV^T.

This resulted in 100 passed cases and 0 failed cases.


---------------- Test # 2 ----------------

Performed SVD using implemented algorithm on 100 real tall matrices A 
each of random size mxn for m > n in [1, 50] and checked whether U are semi-orthogonal, 
V are orthogonal and whether A = USV^T.

This resulted in 100 passed cases and 0 failed cases.


---------------- Test # 3 ----------------

Performed SVD using implemented algorithm on 100 real tall matrices A 
each of random size mxn for m > n in [1, 50] and checked whether the pseudo-inverse 
computed using SVD class satisfies AA^-A = A.

This resulted in 100 passed cases and 0 failed cases.


---------------- Test # 4 ----------------

Performed SVD using implemented algorithm on 100 real tall matrices A 
each of random size mxn for m > n in [1, 50] and checked whether the least squares 
solution to the overdetermined system of linear equations Ax = b matched the solution 
obtained using the QR-decomposition algorithm implemented in the homework.

This resulted in 100 passed cases and 0 failed cases.


---------------- Test # 5 ----------------

Performed SVD using implemented algorithm on 100 real tall matrices A 
each of random size mxn for m > n in [1, 50] and checked that in the limiting case 
where r = Rank(A), that the rank-r approximation of A is equal to A itself.

This resulted in 100 passed cases and 0 failed cases.


---------------- Test # 6 ----------------

Performed SVD using implemented algorithm on 100 real symmetric square matrices A 
each of random size in [1, 50] and checked whether the computed rank agreed with the 
one obtained using EVD of A.

This resulted in 100 passed cases and 0 failed cases.
